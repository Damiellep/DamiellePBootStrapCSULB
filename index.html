        <p class="lead">Hello everyone! I am a chemical engineering undergraduate. Outside of school, my hobbies are working on cars, computers, and going snow boarding. My initial interest in computers began with just video games. I started off with a few laptops, then decided to build a custom PC and that was one of the best decisions of my life because it further inspired my interest with regards to computers. I also played around with coding in Unreal Engine 4, when I was learning C++. My interests in the automotive field were fueled by personal interests in modified vehicles and the amount of personality a modified vehicle can obtain. I usually go snow boarding ever year at Big Bear as well. Overall,  

I am a only child and I also have an assosciates in computer science. My overall goal is to obtain a bachelors in Chemical Engineering because of a promise I made to my mom when I was younger. The promise was that I would be the one to create the Potion of Immortality.
